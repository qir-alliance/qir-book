## Intermediate Representation (IR)
It serves as an intermediate step between the high-level source code and the machine code or executable output. The IR abstraction opens up the possibility of analysis, optimization and code generation, an abstraction level away from execution. [LLVM](qir-book/concepts/why-LLVM.md) IR is the form used to represent code in the QIR compiler projects such as QAT.
## Code Block
Blocks are linear sequences of instructions in a program, distinguished by having a sole entry point and exit point. Blocks are utilized for analyzing and optimizing code, as they provide a structured representation of program of the order in which instructions or statements are executed. Blocks are also used to represent control flow graphs (CFGs).
