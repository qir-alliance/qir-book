Teleportation technique contains heterogeneous instructions at the compilation time. The interdependent conditionals following the measurement of the source and the auxiliary qubits in teleportation determine the next quantum gate operations on the target qubit.\n","\n","Computations involving heterogeneous instructions at compile time can benefit from QIR enabled compilers. QIR is generated in LLVM, which is backed by decades of classical compilation research and development. Hybrid quantum algorithms were [defined](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2207.06850.pdf) to rely on both classical and quantum resources to fulfill the abstract computational model of the algorithm. In the next series of tutorials, a hybrid classical-quantum algorithm such as VQE or HHL (?) will be used to demonstrate further capabilities of QIR."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["// Building on https://github.com/microsoft/Quantum/blob/main/samples/getting-started/teleportation/TeleportationSample.qs\n","// Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.\n","// Licensed under the MIT License.\n","open Microsoft.Quantum.Intrinsic;\n","open Microsoft.Quantum.Canon;\n","open Microsoft.Quantum.Measurement;\n","open Microsoft.Quantum.Core;\n","open Microsoft.Quantum.Arrays;"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["// Converts data type: int to bool \n","operation int2bool(bit: Int) : Bool {\n","        if (bit == 1){return true;}\n","        else {return false;}\n","    }\n","// Converts data type: bool to int \n"," operation bool2int(msg: Bool) : Int {\n","        if (msg == true){return 1;}\n","        else {return 0;}\n","    }\n","// Pure quantum section of teleportation technique \n","operation Teleport (msg : Qubit, target : Qubit) : Unit {\n","    use register = Qubit();\n","\n","    H(register);\n","    CNOT(register, target);\n","\n","    CNOT(msg, register);\n","    H(msg);\n","\n","\n","    if (MResetZ(msg) == One) { Z(target); }\n","\n","    if (IsResultOne(MResetZ(register))) { X(target); }\n","}\n","// Interdependent conditional section of teleportation technique \n","operation TeleportClassicalMessage (message : Bool) : Bool {\n","   \n","    use (msg, target) = (Qubit(), Qubit());\n","\n","   \n","    if (message) {\n","        X(msg);\n","    }\n","\n"," \n","    Teleport(msg, target);\n","\n","    \n","    return MResetZ(target) == One;\n","}"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"collapsed":true,"jupyter":{"outputs_hidden":true},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["// Runs teleporation with 2 loops: classical and hetrogenous \n","operation Greetings() : Unit { \n","    mutable binary=[1, 0, 1, 0, 0];\n","    let msg = ForEach(int2bool, binary);\n","    let transferred= ForEach(TeleportClassicalMessage, msg);\n","    for index in 0 ..
